# MLAgents Soccer
A simple soccer game in Unity where agents are trained using Reinforcement Learning via the MLAgents plugin. 

## About
This project was developed for my project in a Machine Learning course (CMPT 419/726 at Simon Fraser University). Due to the full project's size, I could not include everything, but there should be enough files here to re-create the project. All the code is available here.  

There is a [poster](https://github.com/TrevRawr/mlagents-soccer/blob/master/poster.pdf) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk3YUKErUZc&feature=youtu.be) which demonstrate my project.

## Thanks
Thanks to Blake Schreurs for his [Environment Duplicator](https://github.com/dracolytch/ML-Simplest-Scenario/blob/master/Simple-Scenario-0-5/Common/EnvironmentDuplicator.cs) script which helped speed up training, and [Unity-ML-Training-Manager](https://github.com/dracolytch/Unity-ML-Training-Manager) for automation, which I didn't end up using due to technical difficulties, but the files are still in this project.
Blake's [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZu8GD0ChvDz_lm8EuF7Xx_zzWx-IL8_u) on Machine Learning in Unity is also very helpful!
